# Founder-Led Reddit Strategy: "The Vulnerable Builder"

Based on your "Reddit Cracked" insights, we are pivoting to a high-risk, high-reward strategy.

**Core Philosophy:**
> "Want to stand where no one else stands? You must endure what no one else endures."

## 1. Identity Shift: The "Real" Person
Instead of hiding behind a generic brand or anonymous username, we lean into **Authenticity**.

*   **Profile:** Use your real photo (headshot).
*   **Name:** "Hung Hoang" (or similar real name).
*   **Bio:** "Indie dev building LearnifyTube. 100% Open Source. I share everything I learn."
*   **Link:** The ONLY place your product link lives is in your bio. Never in the post body unless explicitly asked.

## 2. Content Strategy: Radical Transparency ("How I Did It")
We stop "promoting" the product and start **teaching the process**.

**The Angle:**
"I built a YouTube downloader not to make money, but because I have ADHD/focus issues and YouTube's algorithm was winning."

**Post Structure:**
1.  **The Pain (Personal):** "I had 500 videos in Watch Later. I felt like a failure."
2.  **The Technical Journey:** "I tried yt-dlp, but it script-based. I wanted a GUI. So I learned Electron + React + SQLite."
3.  **The "Secret Sauce" (Value):** Share the code. Share the struggle. Share the specific "Aha!" moment (e.g., the Ghost Window bug).
4.  **The "Ask" (Humility):** "I'm not an expert. This is just my attempt. I'd love to know how you would have solved the [X] problem better?"

**Zero Links:**
*   **Post Body:** NO LINKS to the website. Only links to the GitHub repo (maybe) or screenshots/code snippets.
*   **Call to Action:** "If you want to roast my code, here's the GitHub." (Reverse psychology).

## 3. Engagement: The "Naive Learner" Defense
When the inevitable hate comes ("Another downloader?", "Electron bloat!", "Spam"):

*   **Do NOT:** Argue, defend, or justify.
*   **DO:** Be the "Golden Retriever".
    *   *Hater:* "Electron is trash, use native."
    *   *You:* "You're totally right, native is faster. I just know React best so I started there. If I were to rebuild in Rust/Tauri, where should I start? Any resources you recommend?"
*   **Result:** The community sees a humble person being bullied and steps in to defend you.

## 4. Proposed New Post Concepts

### Concept A: The "Technical Struggle" (r/webdev, r/electronjs)
**Title:** "I spent 3 weeks fighting macOS permissions just to stream a video file (Electron + Drizzle)"
**Content:** Deep dive into the `DEMUXER_ERROR` and the "Ghost Window" bug. Show the code that failed. Show the fix.
**Goal:** Earn respect through technical transparency.

### Concept B: The "Productivity Philosophy" (r/productivity)
**Title:** "Why I stopped 'watching' tutorials and started 'downloading' them"
**Content:** The philosophy of "Offline First" learning. How disconnecting from the internet actually helped you finish a course.
**Goal:** resonate with the "tutorial hell" pain point.

### Concept C: The "Open Source" Story (r/opensource)
**Title:** "I built an app to organize my YouTube learning. It’s messy, but it’s free and local-first."
**Content:** "Here is my repo. Here is my stack. I'm looking for feedback on my SQLite schema."
**Goal:** Contributors and stars.

## 5. Implementation Plan
1.  **Update Reddit Profile**: Change Avatar to real photo. Update Bio.
2.  **Select Target Subreddit**: `r/webdev` or `r/opensource` (Concept A or C).
3.  **Draft the "Story" Post**: Write the "Technical Struggle" post.
4.  **Hit Post**: Ignore the fear.
5.  **Kill with Kindness**: Reply to every comment with extreme humility.
