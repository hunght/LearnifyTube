PART 1: THE "FOUNDER STORY" (High Value Post)
=============================================================================
**Target Subreddit:** r/electronjs OR r/webdev
**Title:** I spent 3 weeks fighting macOS permissions just to stream a video file (Electron + Drizzle)

**Body:**

I honestly thought building a local video player would be simple. "It's just `HTML5 <video>`, right?"

I was wrong.

I’m building an open-source app (LearnifyTube) to organize my 500+ "Watch Later" YouTube videos. The goal was simple: download them via `yt-dlp` and play them offline.

**The "Ghost" Bug** 👻
I started getting reports that after closing the video player, usage of the desktop underneath was blocked. It was like a transparent window was stuck there.
Turns out, my "hidden" background worker (which I used to run the ffmpeg stream) wasn't fully detaching/closing in specific macOS versions. I had to manually implement a `myWindow.webContents.openDevTools({ mode: 'detach' })` hack just to SEE what was happening.

**The Permissions Nightmare** 🔐
Then came macOS Sandbox.
If you try to stream a file from `Downloads` into a sandboxed Electron app, you get the dreaded `DEMUXER_ERROR_COULD_NOT_OPEN`.
I didn't want to disable the sandbox (security risk).

**The Solution:**
I ended up implementing a "streaming server" inside the main process using Node streams, bypassing the renderer's file access limitations entirely.
It’s messy, but it works.

If anyone else is fighting Electron + Local File Permissions, I referenced my implementation here:

(Roast my code if you want, I'm primarily a React dev getting humbled by the Main Process).
