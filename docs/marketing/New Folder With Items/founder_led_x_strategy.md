# Founder-Led X.com Strategy: "Build in Public, Learn in Public"

Based on the "Vulnerable Builder" philosophy, adapted for X.com's rapid-fire, conversation-driven format.

**Core Philosophy:**
> "Earn attention through generosity. Build trust through transparency. Never ask for the sale."

  Indie dev building in public from Hanoi 🇻🇳
  Building: LearnifyTube & iTracksy (both open source)
  1,362 commits this year | Learning: Electron, React, SQLite
  Sharing: Code, bugs, honest dev struggles
  ```
  *Alternative (focus on achievements):*
  ```
  Open source builder from Vietnam | GitHub Arctic Code Vault Contributor
  Creating: LearnifyTube + iTracksy (63⭐)
  TypeScript · Electron · React | Building in public
  117 repos · 1.3k+ contributions/year
  ```
- **Banner:** Screenshot showing your 1,362 contributions graph or your desk setup in Hanoi
- **Link:** Keep github.com/hunght (shows both projects)

**Key Principle:** Your profile says "I'm a builder" not "I'm a seller"

**Your Advantages:**
1. **14+ years on X** (since 2009) = established account = better reach
2. **Proven track record**: 1,362 contributions this year = you actually ship
3. **Two products**: iTracksy (63 stars) proves you can build successful projects
4. **GitHub achievements** = credibility in the dev community

## 2. Content Pillars: The 5-Type Tweet Strategy

### Pillar 1: "Daily Build Updates" (40% of content)
**Format:** Short, transparent progress updates

**Examples:**
- "Day 23 of building LearnifyTube: Finally fixed the macOS permission bug that haunted me for 3 weeks. The issue? Electron's security model + SQLite file paths. Here's what I learned: [mini-thread]"
- "Rewrote the video player 4 times. Each version taught me something. Here's what each version got wrong (and why)..."
- "Just hit 1,000 lines of TypeScript deleted. Simplified my category system from 5 files to 1 function. Code: [gist link]"

**Goal:** Show consistent work, not consistent wins.

### Pillar 2: "Technical Lessons" (30% of content)
**Format:** Actionable dev tips from your journey

**Examples:**
- "🧵 Thread: 5 SQLite mistakes I made building a local-first app (and how to avoid them)"
- "Why I chose Drizzle ORM over Prisma for an Electron app (spoiler: bundle size isn't the main reason)"
- "Hot take: Sometimes the 'wrong' tech stack is the right choice. Here's why I used Electron despite the criticism..."

**Goal:** Teach what you're learning in real-time.

### Pillar 3: "Vulnerable Moments" (15% of content)
**Format:** Raw, honest struggles

**Examples:**
- "Spent 6 hours debugging. The bug? A typo. The lesson? Take breaks. (I'm bad at this.)"
- "Imposter syndrome hit hard today. Saw someone's Rust rewrite and thought 'my Electron app is garbage.' Then I remembered: shipped > perfect."
- "200 GitHub stars. 5 active users. Trying not to obsess over metrics. (Failing.)"

**Goal:** Humanize the journey. People connect with struggle.

### Pillar 4: "Community Engagement" (10% of content)
**Format:** Genuine questions and discussions

**Examples:**
- "For devs building Electron apps: How do you handle video streaming without CORS issues? I'm using a ghost window workaround but curious if there's a cleaner way?"
- "What's your take: Should a YouTube organizer support playlists from day 1, or is that feature bloat? Building in public means I can ask you directly."
- "Poll: You download YouTube videos for... [A] Learning/courses [B] Offline viewing [C] Archiving [D] Other"

**Goal:** Listen more than you speak. Build relationships.

### Pillar 5: "Celebration & Gratitude" (5% of content)
**Format:** Small wins and thank yous

**Examples:**
- "Someone opened their first issue on my repo today. This is why I love open source."
- "Thank you @[dev_who_helped] for the tip on IPC optimization. Reduced startup time by 40%."
- "Milestone: LearnifyTube can now handle 10,000 videos without crashing. Not glamorous, but it matters."

**Goal:** Show you appreciate the community.

## 3. Posting Strategy: Consistency Over Virality

**Frequency:**
- **Minimum:** 2 tweets/day (1 build update + 1 lesson/engagement)
- **Optimal:** 3-4 tweets/day
- **Maximum:** Never more than 6/day (avoid spam perception)

**Timing:**
- **Morning (7-9 AM PT):** "What I'm working on today" type updates
- **Afternoon (12-2 PM PT):** Technical lessons/threads
- **Evening (6-8 PM PT):** Vulnerable moments/community questions

**Golden Rules:**
1. **Never self-promote in the tweet body** - Product link only in bio
2. **Never use hashtags** - They scream "trying too hard"
3. **Never post screenshots of analytics** - Focus on building, not metrics
4. **Always respond to comments** - Within 2 hours if possible

## 4. Engagement Tactics: The "Reply Guy" Strategy (But Value-Driven)

**Target Accounts to Engage With:**
- **Electron/React devs** (e.g., @sindresorhus, @evanwallace, @electron_js)
- **Indie makers** (e.g., @levelsio, @swizec, @dannypostmaa)
- **Open source maintainers** (e.g., @t3dotgg, @Rich_Harris, @youyuxi)
- **Asian tech community** (leverage your Vietnam location for unique perspective)

**How to Engage:**
- **DO:** Add value to their tweets
  - "Great point about state management. I ran into similar with [X] and solved it by [Y]. Code: [link]"
- **DON'T:** Generic replies
  - ❌ "Great post!"
  - ❌ "This! 🔥"
  - ❌ "Check out my project"

**The 3-Value-Adds-Per-Reply Rule:**
Every reply must contain at least ONE of:
1. A specific technical insight
2. A relevant code example/resource
3. A thoughtful question that moves the conversation forward

## 5. Content Examples: First 2 Weeks

### Day 1:
**Tweet 1 (Option A - New Journey):**
"Starting a new experiment: Building LearnifyTube in public. It's a local-first YouTube organizer built in Hanoi. Using Electron + React + SQLite. Will share every bug, every decision, every mistake. Let's go. 🛠️"

**Tweet 1 (Option B - Leverage Track Record):**
"1,362 commits this year. Built iTracksy (63⭐). Now building LearnifyTube - a local-first YouTube organizer for learners. Going to build this one completely in public. Electron + React + SQLite. Every bug, every lesson. From Hanoi with ☕"

**Tweet 2:**
"Question for Electron devs: What's your preferred way to handle IPC between main/renderer? I'm using contextBridge but curious if there's a lighter pattern for simple CRUD operations."

**Additional Context You Can Use:**
- "After 14 years on X, finally going to build in public"
- "117 repos, but this is the first one I'm building completely transparently"
- "Built iTracksy to 63 stars quietly. Let's try a different approach with LearnifyTube."

### Day 3:
**Tweet:** "🧵 Why I chose SQLite over cloud for LearnifyTube:

1. Your data stays on YOUR computer
2. Works offline (obviously)
3. No scaling costs
4. No privacy concerns
5. Simpler for a solo dev

Downsides: No sync (yet). But that's a feature, not a bug. Here's why..."

[Continue thread with 4-5 more tweets explaining the philosophy]

### Day 7:
**Tweet:** "Week 1 complete. Built:
- Video metadata importer
- Basic SQLite schema
- Category system

Broke:
- macOS permissions (3 times)
- My confidence (4 times)

Learned:
- Electron's security model is no joke
- Test on all platforms early

Next week: Video player"

### Day 10:
**Tweet:** "Just published my first dev blog post: 'The Ghost Window Pattern for Electron Video Streaming'

It's a weird workaround for CORS issues. I couldn't find this documented anywhere, so I documented it.

No paywall. No email capture. Just the solution.

[Link to blog/gist]"

## 6. What NOT to Do (Critical)

**NEVER:**
- ❌ "Check out LearnifyTube" tweets
- ❌ "We just launched on Product Hunt"
- ❌ "Download now" CTAs
- ❌ Feature announcement threads without technical depth
- ❌ Comparison tweets ("LearnifyTube vs Competitor")
- ❌ Growth hacking threads ("How I got 1000 users in 30 days")
- ❌ "Follow for more" anywhere

**Why?** These scream "I'm here to sell you." You're here to **build trust**.

## 7. The Long Game: When Can You "Sell"?

**Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Pure Value**
- 0% product mentions in tweets
- 100% building in public + teaching
- Goal: 500+ followers of fellow developers

**Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Soft Context**
- Occasional "I built X feature in LearnifyTube, here's the technical breakdown" tweets
- Product is the EXAMPLE, not the PITCH
- Goal: 1,500+ followers, regular engagement

**Phase 3 (Months 7+): Natural Promotion**
- By now, people KNOW what you're building
- They ask about it
- You can share "LearnifyTube v2.0 is out" as a milestone, not a pitch
- Goal: Community-driven growth

**Key Metric:** When people start tweeting about your project WITHOUT you asking, you've won.

## 8. Implementation Checklist

### Week 1: Setup
- [ ] Update X profile (@hugboringdev)
  - [ ] Update display name (add emoji or project mention)
  - [ ] Refine bio (see recommendations above)
  - [ ] Add banner image (code screenshot or workspace)
  - [ ] Ensure GitHub link is prominent
- [ ] Follow 50 relevant accounts (Electron devs, indie makers, open source)
- [ ] Write 14 tweets in advance (2 per day buffer)
- [ ] Set up a simple content calendar (Notion/Google Sheets)
- [ ] Review existing followers/following for re-engagement opportunities

### Week 2-4: Consistency
- [ ] Post 2-3 times daily (build updates + lessons)
- [ ] Reply to 10+ tweets per day (add genuine value)
- [ ] Share 1 technical deep-dive thread per week
- [ ] Track engagement (what resonates, what doesn't)

### Month 2+: Amplification
- [ ] Repurpose best tweets into blog posts (link in bio)
- [ ] Collaborate with 1-2 other indie devs (co-stream coding, guest threads)
- [ ] Start a weekly "Dev Q&A" thread (teach what you learned that week)
- [ ] Celebrate community wins (contributors, users sharing their use cases)

## 9. The "Golden Retriever" Defense (X Version)

When criticism comes (it will):

**Hater:** "Why another YouTube downloader? There are 1000 already."

**❌ Wrong Response:** "LearnifyTube is different because [features]"

**✅ Right Response:** "You're right, there are tons! I built this mostly to learn Electron/SQLite. What's your favorite downloader? I'd love to see what I should have done differently."

**Result:**
- Hater either ghosts or recommends a tool (you learn)
- Community sees humility and defends you
- Third-party followers see you as reasonable

## 10. Measurement (But Don't Obsess)

**Track Weekly:**
- Follower count (growth rate, not absolute number)
- Engagement rate (replies/likes per tweet)
- Profile clicks (how many people check your bio?)
- GitHub stars/traffic from X

**Ignore:**
- Viral tweets (one-hit wonders don't build trust)
- Comparison to other accounts (your journey is unique)
- Follower count of non-engaged accounts (bots/inactive users)

**Success Indicator:**
You know it's working when:
1. People reply with technical discussions (not just "nice!")
2. Other devs @ you when someone asks about Electron/React
3. Your GitHub issues come from X followers
4. You get DMs asking for advice (not pitching you)

---

## Final Philosophy: "The Best Marketing Is No Marketing"

The goal isn't to "market" LearnifyTube. The goal is to become **Hung, the dev who builds in public and teaches along the way.**

LearnifyTube is a side effect of your generosity.

When people trust you, they'll try what you build.

**Don't sell the product. Sell the journey.**
