# LearnifyTube
**Date:** December 9, 2025
**Status:** 🟢 Active / Recovered
**Current Phase:** Founder-Led Growth (Shifted from "Promotion")

## 🚀 Executive Summary
We successfully pivoted from a failed "promotional" attempt to a "Vulnerable Founder" strategy.
*   **Crisis Averted:** Recovered a Reddit thread that was receiving hate ("AI slop") by owning the mistake and linking the repo.
*   **Karma Pipeline:** Drafted/Posted across 6 targeted niches (Electron, MacApps, DataHoarder, etc).
*   **Product:** Updated README with a demo video to improve conversion from Reddit traffic.
*   **Next Big Move:** Drafting the "Technical Struggle" story post for r/electronjs.
While we successfully executed the initial "Week 1" plan and identified high-value opportunities, we encountered technical and platform-specific blockers (browser timeouts and karma restrictions). We have pivoted to a **Manual Karma Building Strategy** to establish account credibility before attempting major promotional posts like "Show HN".

## 🚧 Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Impact | Solution Implemented |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Archived Threads** | Cannot comment on old high-value threads. | Pivoted research to filter for "Last 30 Days" (Nov/Dec 2025). |
| **Browser Timeouts** | Automated posting failed for some threads. | Created **Manual Posting Guides** for the user to post directly. |
| **Karma Restrictions** | "Show HN" post removed by AutoMod. | Developed a **Karma Building Strategy** to reach 50-100 karma first. |

## 🔄 Current Strategy: Karma Building

We are currently in a **"Give Before You Ask"** phase. The goal is to build 50-100 comment karma by being genuinely helpful before attempting to promote LearnifyTube again.

### Key Resources Created
1.  **`reddit_karma_building_strategy.md`**: The high-level game plan.
2.  **`manual_karma_building_guide.md`**: A tactical guide containing:
    -   **5 Ready-to-Use Comment Templates** (Learning Organization, Motivation, Tutorial Hell, etc.).
    -   **Specific Active Threads** found today.
    -   **Drafted Comments** tailored to those threads (refined for natural tone).

## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (User)
1.  **Open `manual_karma_building_guide.md`**.
2.  **Post the 2 drafted comments** to the identified `r/learnprogramming` threads.
3.  **Spend 15 mins/day** browsing `r/learnprogramming/new` and `r/webdev/new` to answer questions using the provided templates.

### Upcoming Milestones
-   **[ ] Reach 10 Karma:** Validates account is active.
-   **[ ] Reach 50 Karma:** Unlocks posting in stricter subreddits.
-   **[ ] Retry "Show HN":** Post the drafted `r/opensource` content.

### Alternative Channels
While building Reddit karma, consider posting the "Show HN" content to:
-   **Hacker News** (No karma limit for new accounts).
-   **Product Hunt**.
-   **Indie Hackers**.
